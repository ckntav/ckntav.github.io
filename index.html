Hi, I’m Chris. I’m a computational biologist with a PhD in Bioinformatics from Université Laval in Québec, Canada.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I specialize in integrating various omics data, including high-throughput sequencing datasets such as ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and Hi-C, to explore the role of chromatin structure in gene regulation. My work aims to uncover the intricate mechanisms by which chromatin architecture influences gene expression, particularly in response to external stimuli.

Welcome! As a computational biologist, I constantly dive into complex datasets and develop scripts to uncover biological insights. This blog serves as my knowledge repository, where I document and share the techniques and functions I frequently use but often forget, saving me from endless googling.

# Whether it’s an R script for plotting, a Python function for data manipulation, or command-line tricks for genomic analysis, it will be documented here.
