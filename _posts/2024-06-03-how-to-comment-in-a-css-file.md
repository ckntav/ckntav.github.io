## Purpose of comments
Comments in a CSS file are used to provide explanations or annotations within the code. They are helpful for:
- Describing the purpose of specific styles.
- Temporarily disabling code.
- Providing information to other developers.

## Syntax
Comments are enclosed within `/*` and `*/`. Any text between these markers is ignored by the browser.

## Multi-line comment
```css
/* 
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
h1 {
    font-size: 2em; /* Set font size for headings */
    color: #333; /* Set text color to dark grey */
}
```

## Deactivating code:
You can use comments to temporarily disable a line of CSS code. This is useful when you want to test changes without permanently removing code.

```css
/* Styling the navigation menu */
/* .navbar {
    background-color: #333; 
} */

.navbar {
    color: #fff; /* White text color */
}
```

In the example above, the `background-color` property for `.navbar` is commented out, deactivating it.

Important Points:

  • Comments do not nest.
  • Use comments for better readability and maintainability.

Using comments effectively makes your CSS easier to understand and maintain.
