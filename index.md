Welcome! As a computational biologist, I constantly dive into complex datasets and develop scripts to uncover biological insights. This blog serves as my knowledge repository, where I document and share the techniques and functions I frequently use but often forget, saving me from endless googling.

# Whether itâ€™s an R script for plotting, a Python function for data manipulation, or command-line tricks for genomic analysis, it will be documented here.
