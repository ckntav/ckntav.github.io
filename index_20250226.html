Hi, I’m Chris. I’m a computational biologist and a PhD candidate in Dr. Steve Bilodeau’s lab at Université Laval in Québec, Canada. My research focuses on understanding transcriptional regulation in the context of 3D genome architecture. I expect to graduate in Winter 2025.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I specialize in integrating various omics data, including high-throughput sequencing datasets such as ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and Hi-C, to explore the role of chromatin structure in gene regulation. My work aims to uncover the intricate mechanisms by which chromatin architecture influences gene expression, particularly in response to external stimuli.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I’m looking for opportunities to apply data-driven approaches and work on projects using cutting-edge technologies (single-cell omics, spatial transcriptomics…) with significant clinical implications.
</p>

Preferred location: Canada 🇨🇦 or open to remote opportunities 🌐

Welcome! As a computational biologist, I constantly dive into complex datasets and develop scripts to uncover biological insights. This blog serves as my knowledge repository, where I document and share the techniques and functions I frequently use but often forget, saving me from endless googling.

# Whether it’s an R script for plotting, a Python function for data manipulation, or command-line tricks for genomic analysis, it will be documented here.
